<summary><strong><u>When / where does Troop SC-2244 meet?</u></strong></summary>
Troop SC-2244 is chartered with <a href="https://www.eastpickens.org" target="_blank" class="faq">East Pickens Baptist Church</a>, a Southern Baptist Church located at 2244 Gentry Memorial Hwy between Pickens and Easley, SC. EastPickens.org
<br /><br />
The troop meets the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> Thursday nights from 6:15 - 8:00 for regular troop meetings throughout the Pickens County School Year. During these meetings the Trailmen participate in a devotional time and work toward earning branches or badges for the various troop levels through instructional and hands-on activities. Each third Thursday of the month the Trailmen focus on the Worthy Life Award, the spiritually-focused component of the Trail Life program.
<br /><br />
On certain dates throughout the program year the Woodlands Trailmen (elementary age) hold Hit the Trail events specifically related to their branch work. These events are typically off-campus and are posted on our calendar.
<br /><br />
Navigators and Adventurers also have periodic outings and special events that are more challenging than those experienced at the Woodlands level. Some provide an opportunity to fulfill the requirements of a specific badge, and some are just for fun!
<br /><br />
There are also three-day, area-wide camping events for Trailmen. “The Elements” is usually held in early November each year for the Navigators and Adventurers, and “The Woodlands Trail Junction” is held in late April for the Woodlands Trailmen. As part of the “boy-led troop” philosophy of Trail Life, the Navigators and Adventurers plan and execute “The Woodlands Trail Junction” with the guidance of the Area Adult Leadership.
<br /><br />
Finally, there are a couple of troop-wide campouts when the schedule allows. One is associated with a workday where our Trailmen participate in preparing the campus of East Pickens Baptist Church for the Easter season by helping with yard work or any other tasks assigned.
<br /><br />
Navigators and Adventurers may continue to meet during the summer to work on badges as the Trailmen determine.

<summary><strong><u>Who can be a Woodlands Trail, Navigators, or Adventurers Trailman?</u></strong></summary>
All boys, ages 5 through 17, are welcome regardless of religion, race, national origin, or socio-economic status. We welcome boys whose parents are seeking a faith-based outdoor adventure program that places an emphasis on character development, leadership, and moral purity, and who aspire to live in accordance with the values expressed in the Motto and Oath.
</details>

<p><br /></p>
<details>
<summary><strong><u>What are the ages for the troops?</u></strong></summary>
<strong>Foxes:</strong> Kindergarten and at least 5 years old by October 31st
<br /><br />
<strong>Hawks:</strong> 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Graders
<br /><br />
<strong>Mountain Lions:</strong> 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Graders
<br /><br />
<strong>Navigators:</strong> 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> Graders
<br /><br />
<strong>Adventurers:</strong> 9<sup>th</sup> - 12<sup>th</sup> Grade. However, once a Trailman turns 18, he is no longer
able to be an Adventurer, even if he has not yet graduated high school.
<br /><br />
<strong>Guidon Unit:</strong> Young adults ages 18-25 years old
<br /><br />
<em>*Exceptions to the above requirements may be made on a case-by-case basis by consensus of the Troop Committee.</em>
</details>

<p><br /></p>
<details>
<summary><strong><u>Are non-Christians allowed to join TLUSA?</u></strong></summary>
Our Member Policy allows for boys of any faith (or no faith at all) to participate in the program of Trail Life USA.
<br /><br />
Local Charter Organizations satisfy the specific ministry goals of their church or organization. In some cases, that may be as an outreach ministry to boys in the community. In other cases, that may be as an in-reach ministry specifically to minister to the families or members of the local church or organization. Therefore, individual Charter Organizations may have more specific membership requirements that limit Troop membership to boys of a certain faith or membership in a certain organization.
</details>

<p><br /></p>
<details>
<summary><strong><u>How does faith play into the TLUSA program?</u></strong></summary>
As a Christ-centered organization, our faith is woven throughout the program without being necessarily “religious” or “churchy.” From faith-building options in the advancement program, outdoor worship, as well as more in-depth discipleship opportunities, adult and youth members receive biblical instruction and training in biblical faith. As iron sharpens iron, so too will boys sharpen the faith of their peers. Adult Christian leaders will guide youth in the development of their faith and moral decision-making, as well as sharpen the faith of their adult peers.
</details>

<p><br /></p>
<details>
<summary><strong><u>What is the emphasis of Trail Life USA?</u></strong></summary>
Trail Life USA has 6 Program Emphases: Wisdom, Heritage, Teamwork, Leadership, Character, and Faith. Our program components support youth development, understanding, and practical experiences in these key areas.
</details>

<p><br /></p>
<details>
<summary><strong><u>Do you have or can you recommend a youth program for girls?</u></strong></summary>
We recommend our sister program, the American Heritage Girls (AHG).
<br /><br />
<a href="https://www.eastpickens.org" target="_blank" class="faq">East Pickens Baptist Church</a> also hosts an AHG troop (SC-4224) that meets the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Thursday nights at the same time and location as Trail Life.
<br /><br />
